    "Cutout is a regularization and data augmentation technique for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It involves randomly masking out square regions of input during training. This helps to improve the robustness and overall performance of CNNs by encouraging the network to better utilize the full context of the image, rather than relying on the presence of a small set of specific visual features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cutout is computationally efficient as it can be applied during data loading in parallel with the main training task. It can be used in conjunction with existing forms of data augmentation and other regularizers to further improve model performance.\n",

    "The technique has been evaluated with state-of-the-art architectures on popular image recognition datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN, often achieving state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art results."

    "\n",
    "<!-- To do: explain the code with reference to section 3.2. Implementation Details -->\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code provided above, we see a Python class named Cutout defined. This class is designed to apply the Cutout data augmentation technique to an image. Below is an explanation of the class and its methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The Cutout class is initialized with two parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `n_holes`: the number of patches to cut out of each image.\n",
    "    -   `length`: the length (in pixels) of each square patch.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The `__call__` method implements the Cutout technique. This method takes as input a tensor `img` representing an image, and returns the same image with `n_holes` number of patches of dimension `length` x `length` cut out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a step-by-step explanation of what’s happening inside the `__call__` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The method first retrieves the height h and width w of the input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  A mask is then initialized as a 2D numpy array of ones with the same dimensions as the input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  The method then enters a loop which runs for n_holes iterations. In each iteration:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   A pair of coordinates y and x are randomly selected within the height and width of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   The method then calculates the coordinates of a square patch around the (y, x) coordinate. The patch has a length of length pixels, and the method ensures that the patch doesn’t fall outside the image by using the np.clip function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   The corresponding area in the mask is set to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  The mask is then converted to a PyTorch tensor and expanded to the same number of channels as the input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Finally, the method applies the mask to the input image, effectively setting the pixels in the masked regions to zero, and returns the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to import necessary libraries like numpy (np) and PyTorch (torch) before running this class definition. The class Cutout can then be used as part of your data augmentation pipeline when training your models.\n",
    "\n",

In effect, dropout simulates ensembling a large number of neural networks with different architectures, which makes the model more robust.\n",
