    "In the code provided above, we see a Python class named Cutout defined. This class is designed to apply the Cutout data augmentation technique to an image. Below is an explanation of the class and its methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The Cutout class is initialized with two parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   `n_holes`: the number of patches to cut out of each image.\n",
    "    -   `length`: the length (in pixels) of each square patch.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The `__call__` method implements the Cutout technique. This method takes as input a tensor `img` representing an image, and returns the same image with `n_holes` number of patches of dimension `length` x `length` cut out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a step-by-step explanation of what’s happening inside the `__call__` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The method first retrieves the height h and width w of the input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  A mask is then initialized as a 2D numpy array of ones with the same dimensions as the input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  The method then enters a loop which runs for n_holes iterations. In each iteration:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   A pair of coordinates y and x are randomly selected within the height and width of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   The method then calculates the coordinates of a square patch around the (y, x) coordinate. The patch has a length of length pixels, and the method ensures that the patch doesn’t fall outside the image by using the np.clip function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   The corresponding area in the mask is set to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  The mask is then converted to a PyTorch tensor and expanded to the same number of channels as the input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Finally, the method applies the mask to the input image, effectively setting the pixels in the masked regions to zero, and returns the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to import necessary libraries like numpy (np) and PyTorch (torch) before running this class definition. The class Cutout can then be used as part of your data augmentation pipeline when training your models.\n",

    "Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) is a technique that provides visual explanations for decisions made by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. It uses the gradients of any target concept, flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting the important regions in the image for predicting the concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grad-CAM is not limited to a specific architecture, it can be applied to a wide range of CNN models without any changes to their existing structure or requiring re-training. It’s also class-discriminative, allowing it to effectively manage multi-label scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "By visualizing the model’s focus areas with Grad-CAM, we can assess how effectively Cutout is encouraging the model to use a broader range of features. For example, if a model trained with Cutout still primarily focuses on a single region, that might suggest the Cutout squares are too small, or not numerous enough. Conversely, if the focus areas are well spread across the image, it would confirm that Cutout is indeed pushing the model to generalize better.\n",
