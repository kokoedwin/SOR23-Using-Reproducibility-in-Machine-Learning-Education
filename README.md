# SOR23 Using Reproducibility in Machine Learning Education

Greetings! I'm Jonathan Edwin, hailing from the picturesque archipelago of Indonesia. This year, I've embarked on an exciting journey as part of the 2023 Summer of Reproducibility initiative. Currently, I'm deeply engrossed in a captivating project named "Enhancing Machine Learning Education through Reproducibility." This project entails crafting educational materials that revolve around replicating essential machine learning techniques like Cutout data augmentation, U-Net, and Siamese networks. The ultimate output will be a series of interactive Jupyter notebooks, meticulously guiding students through the intricacies of these advanced models while fostering practical experience in achieving research reproducibility.
